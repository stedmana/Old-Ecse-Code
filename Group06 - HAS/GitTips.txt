Git Tips:

- To learn the basics of git fast, I recommend https://try.github.io/

- If you are using git via the command line, be VERY careful. Writing "rm X" instead of "git rm X" is very easy
  yet can fucks you up pretty badly (speaking from experience).

- Put the repository (the folder with the .git file) in your Eclipse workspace folder. When you open the project in
  Eclipse for the first time, make sure you set the location to the right folder (DesktopApp, AndroidApp or PHPApp)
  and that the folder is inside the repository folder. If you do this correctly, every icon in the project should
  have a little yellow rectangle on it. Also, the name of your repository folder and the branch you are currently
  using should appear next to the project folder icon.
